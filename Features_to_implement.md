1. Test only on the same video length to understand the all the data properly. It will give you insight on the filters to create for filtering out noise as you will get to see similar number of frames in that pattern.
2. Need to remove the burst of 5 to 10 frames, which can be done by applying a threshold an converting it to a digital signal.
3. Try and see if notch or band pass filter helps?
